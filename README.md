# movie-tv-renamer
## Intro
This script uses imdb and tvdb to rename movie and tv show files into something a little more pretty.  

It is my first python project and I'm using it as a playground to see what the big deal is :)

## TODO
* remove seed after ratio is over threshold (1.25?)
* add logging
* add exception handling
* add parameter checks
* create a python module with pip
* create a python module with no dependencies with pip
