# movie-tv-renamer
## Intro
This script uses imdb and tvdb to rename movie and tv show files into something a little more pretty.  It is my first python project and is far from finished.

## TODO
* override str in media file to show the file path
* dont use handled-content file.  just check all files.  if the renamed symlink/file exists, then do nothing for that file
* remove seed after ratio is over threshold (1.25?)
* add logging
* add exception handling
* add parameter checks
* create a python module with pip
* create a python module with no dependencies with pip
